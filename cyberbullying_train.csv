"Celebrating my first 🌈 Pride month. Out as gay here on Twitter, and to a few in real life people around the US. The hiatus I took the last little while-Restful, insightful, uplifting, & refreshing. I love God, & I'm gay, it's not a sin.   #Queer #PrideMonth",0
two glasses and you define as asexual,0
Pride parades are held in every city in India and they are almost always unopposed.,0
Tell him the truth. Only black gangs have gays and punks. Only.,0
"I thought I was weird that I was often attracted to women but like just wanted to kiss and hold them not be with them haha now, with this beautiful movement of acceptance, I hear more stories like mine and realize I'm normal. It's okay that I have a big crush on Shakira! I'm just human! Hahaha",0
That is a lesbian and you can't tell me otherwise,0
"thank you and i hope your rights and recognition continue to improve.just not like this, competing against non-trans females.",0
Really nice. FPA India stands for the cause of abolishing discrimination against the LGBTQ community and to provide them with equal rights.,0
Eat dick and die bitch xD go cry somewhere else,1
"the red scene genuinely may be one of the incredibly choreographed and moving things i've ever seen... as a fellow gay asian, the struggle between masculine vs feminine is one that is so crushing and it was so beautifully illustrated",0
hahaha funnyy repost haha fuck you faggot fuck fuck you are so fucking like you dumb bitsch,1
NTA. You're being required to be in this homophobic environment all the time. You should do whatever you feel you have to do to protect yourself and get through it.,0
One of the better ones. Especially amongst the other LGBT subreddits,0
"I'm at a bit of a loss too. Any number of churches will think of themselves as using scripture as enduring principles. I get the feeling that the OP has something more specific in mind, like, not liberal. Maybe one that takes a hard line on LGBT folks perhaps? Politically active? Eschews politics? There are a great many variables for what at first glance appears to be a simple question.",0
it's a great day to be gay here at chick fil a. happy pride month from your fave bi-con 💖💜💙,0
That's too hard for like 99% of guys man. It's a tough game now out there with higher and higher % of men with no sex lives. This leads to desperation when pussy finally lands in their lap. A 26 yr old girls sexual history is fucking insane. It's about 10years atleast of guys she's been through yet if she's an HB8 there's a line of schmucks including 'chads' waiting to LTR(& eventually marry) her. The deeper I go down the rabbit hole the more I realize how fucked up shit actually is. And how easy it is to give back into the blue pill likes Cyrus did.,0
"Actually they're both free speech. One just makes you look like an utter piece of shit, while the other protests the first world country that still oppresses LGBT+ and every other minority group.",0

"i am a trans man who doesn't feel dysphoric at the thought of giving birth either and i am not super young so that's the reason why i haven't gotten on t yet, i'm afraid of taking that possibility away from myself (i've always known i was nb but i realized i was trans only about a year ago). i was raised by my father and my mother is non-binary and very masculine so i never associated giving birth and raising a child with femininity. so yeah i'm here to say that you're valid and you should go for it if this is what you want!",0

"This tweet is a joke response to another tweet someone posted ""any woman born after 1995 doesn't know how to cook and only knows how to charge her phone, eat junkfood and be bisexual"" or something like that and is probably just to point out how stupid this logic is.",0
You have to admire queers like this. They just want to fuck each other in the ass with dignity and respect. Meanwhile Nana is out there biting young women. Anthony wishes he had this much class,0
Can't pay for that thousand dollar top or bottom surgery? Well no worries my trans friends!! Jump right in!,0
"I know how you feel. And I hate how this stuff is tearing apart wlw friendships. I'm a lesbian. My first in real life gender critical friend was bi but I also know so many bi women (and even lesbians) who are into all the gender crazy stuff. It's a very difficult terrain to navigate...  No matter what the issue is, having to choose between keeping quiet and feeling angry/guilty all the time or speaking up and losing friends and potentially having other bad shit happen to you is so painful.",0
"1. Yes! I think it's great for children to be proud of their parents, but maybe not pride in sexuality of any kind until their sexuality becomes... Less dormant? 2. I think this is a pride question but I'm having trouble understanding the relevancy. 3. It's not that they don't fully understand pride, its that they don't fully understand sexuality. I don't want kids near sexuality of any kind. No offense, but I made that obvious in my original post.",0
This gay ass blood is gay,0
"@behau5 @iamaaliyahjewel Like a flag isn't going to solve the issues/struggles that the LGBTQ community deals with year round & on a daily basis. It's a matter of respect, empathy & understanding boundaries.",0

"Two of them, both straight, both co-workers, business partners, and co-inventors with me on some things. We talk about their straight and my gay exploits all the time over text and even exchange pics for proof, congratulating each other. It's great. I and the other one who lifts weights share body pics which each other to get encouragement on our progress in bodybuilding. We'd make an awesome throuple if they were gay, but we've got so many financial contracts binding us together at this point we're basically all but married.",0

As a trans woman who has had many hopes dashed before I found my fiance I can tell you with utter certainty that she probably can't even remotely believe she found someone so amazing!,0
"Beautiful video. Glad to see the A added to LGBTQ+ and making LGBTQA+. I am Asexual (hereto romantic)  Was an ally before I found out. I have been afraid to come out, but when I learned what my situation was called and that there are more people like me I was trilled. I can still fall in love with men and still get married. So happy, thank you for the video, it gave me courage. Hello to all the Try Guys. 💜🖤💜🦄",0
"Thanks! I'm lowkey freaking out right now. There's plenty of other open gay people in my office, but I really haven't told anyone outside of my family (and one of my brother's friends who didn't take mer seriously) that I'm pretty freaking gay. It's...a weird feeling but I feel good about it.",0
"The only crossover for me is strictly social. I'm a straight male in the BDSM community. I will grant that not all BDSM activity involves sex, but it is sexual in nature. I don't care to play with anyone I am not sexually attracted to.",0

My God faggots are pathetic,1
"I agree with the poster who recommended Ash Hardell, Their videos helped me a lot when I started to realize I was trans back in January. I still feel weird saying I'm trans and haven't come out yet. I feel like trans masc describes me best for now.  I understand the urge to immediately find the words to match how you identify, but if you're only just starting to figure it out take your time, there's no rush to pic a label and live with it forever.",0
It's Almost as if most people are heterosexual.,0
"As #PrideMonth starts, remember that 50 yrs ago the Stonewall Inn was raided by police giving rise to the Stonewall riots. This is how the lgbtq movement began & our rights are still under attack. Don't stop fighting for equality even if the rights you fight for are not your own. ",0

"This mod is a fucking phaggot, ban me you fucking coward",1
I feel like this was so poorly worded but TL;dr I'm trying to be optimistic in that this is a good thing in the long run for who transfolk are viewed in society. However I agree that we shouldn't celebrate or cheer Victoria Secret's for this.,0

I've been fortunate in that my transition has been smooth and hassle free so far (the court fucked up and it delayed my name change, but that wasn't just me that was the whole city's court filing system)... I hope things can smooth out and progress can become easier for you, so you can share the woman you are with the world.",0

"+AK 74 what i am arguing about is that people who are against homosexuality can have a case, and people who are not against it, can have their own case. If there is no Objective morality, then people cannot push their own subjective morals into others. Just like what society is doing right now with homosexuality, incest, abortion and etc.. there are some sets of morals people have in common, which we should be following. But when issues like LGBTQ comes in place and there is a big divide, the one side cant push their subjective ones into the other.",0

I understood your point and thank you for making it. Part of why as a younger man I felt i couldn't be a dad is becsue it didn't happen nuch at all 15-20 years ago so growing up a family was one man one women. Adoption was done by straight couples who couldn't or didnt want to conceive natuaky. Gay people were never ralked avout as wanting to build families even fron within the comunity. Hopefully my children's generation will be able to see same sex adoption in exactly the same way as straight adoption but for my generation that's not possible.,0

I've said edgy memes about gay people as a bi person, but I still care a lot about their rights.

I realised I was gay when I couldn't stop thinking about her and imagining what it'd be like to hold her hand. It didn't ruin my life but it certainly made the next three years of my life pretty hard with coming out to family and coming to terms with it. I'm happy now though :)",0

SJ is just stunningly beautiful as well as talented, and most important to producers, attracts more people to see her movies. When Morgan Freeman can play God, you've arrived. To get ahead, it helps to be the best, if a transgender person wants that role, maybe start by producing film shorts showcasing their talent?",0
"I just get frustrated with this thread, seeing that the only correct answer is at the bottom while a bunch of incorrect ones gets upvoted. Sexuality isn't something you change, if you have bi-tendencies you've always had them but porn might have made you discover them. Sexuality is a spectrum, you can still be mostly straight with a preference for the opposite gender, but have a small in comparison preference for the same gender. Sexuality isn't something anyone should be ashamed, it isn't something you can force change on, and spreading those misconceptions about it is dangerous",0
"*He. You fucking pathetic trash. Women don't have dicks. You wish you had a vagina you misogynistic pig. We all know you're envious that you will never be a woman so you trash women instead. Your mother would be embarrassed that she raised such a pathetic, misogynistic son.",1

Unfortunately being in an intergenerational relationship has two comings out. One for being gay The other for the age difference. I suspect the harder to accept is the age difference. Interestingly on my case his parents had met me thinking we were sharing an apartment and both comings out for my partner went exceptionally well.  My only advice to you is care for your own happiness as well as theirs.,0

"All the invective attacks against the women of this great US football team are disgraceful and inappropriate. From the comments I am reading, many are misogynistic, homophobic, discriminatory and anti-American. Their football is great. They deserve their accolades and applause. ------------ They are much more well known than their male counterparts, who collapsed *before* the World Cup's sweet-sixteen rounds. The men's game is going backward, whilst the women move forever forward. I bid them all of the best hurtling other teams going forth on their conquests for more victories.",0

"So damn true. I shared a post on Facebook recently about pride events that boiled down to ""don't get made if you see someone in an apparently heterosexual couple at pride, you don't know if they might be bi, trans, ace/aro, questioning, or what"" and some cis-het white guy that I barely know made a comment of ""since when is it okay to discriminate against straight people.""

"Mormons are completely unwilling to be confrontational towards strangers. They might yell at their kids for being gay, but they don't have the guts to yell at a stranger for the same thing.

Agreed. Obama and Hillary views changed as well just like her. There was few candidates in 1990s who were pro gay marriage. This is a topic that has evolved over time. We shouldn't condemn people for putting their egos aside and being willing to change their views when they realize they were in the wrong like tulsi has. She is now very supportive of lgbt.,0

The problem is that everything that makes them great - declarative advices, facts, opinions, and styles of argument, the levity used to reinforce key points, really everything that makes her such an amazing content creator - seems to clash with the low level emotional discomfort that transphobic people feel (as far as I can tell) when asked to think about transgender people and transgender identities.

Interesting that he mentions beautiful sexy women are even more common in women's magazines than in men's. This correlates with the finding that the number one category of porn watched by women is Lesbians. Also related with studies show that most women are bisexual in their arousal patterns. This is both a cause of and reflection of our society that has erotisized the female form as the ultimate in sexuality.,0
Yea those linos do need to be turn straight because in nature males may fuck every like very very rare but they would fuck a female not matter what gay is actually not a thing in real life animals can't be gay technically humans can't but from some reason we think we can do anything and define Mother Nature also I don't think it gey ppl fault that was a bit much,0

Always listened to me. Always took the time ti make me understand when I did something wrong. Always believed in me. Loved me unconditionally. Mom was a bit homophobic (which is common for people of her background). In 2017 I came out as bi and I didn't know how she would handle it. She hugged me and said nothing could ever change her love for me. She's since met my girlfriend. She now also talks to me about how the LGBT+ community deserve to be treated wiyh respect. She has literally always been the best person in my life.,0

"Similar to my grandparents lesbian friends on Long Island in the sixties... one was a NYC judge and the other a bit of a bohemian. They often watched my mom and her siblings and were favorites in the neighborhood, but no one ever addressed their sexuality, just called them spinster friends.  Sad that gay couples couldn't be more open, but good that they weren't ostracized and could be active community members in some places.  It's heartening to know my grandparents loved them so much and gave me some solace as a teen before coming out to them.",0

There's a lot wrong here and I'm not sure where to start.  I guess let's just get the definition of gender right and go from there. You seem to have mixed sexual orientation into gender—which is incorrect.  Gender is just the expressed sex identity. It's what social norms for a sex you express. It has nothing to do with your sexual orientation or preferences in a mate.,0

You ain't finna do shit dumb faggot,1
I disagree. I am gay. I recognize that he was sprinkling in some cute little gay jokes in with his commentary. My straight friends are like this with me. I think it actually reveals a level of comfort with homosexuality rather than homophobia.  Homophobia is more like an aversion or nervousness to even talking about homosexuality. To joke about it in the conservative movement I think is wonderful. Because it's so subjective (your opinion varies from mine) the policy should reflect that no one is infallible and we should just be able to speak our minds freely.,0

It's not a midnight issue. It's a chimpout issue. Happens in broad daylight in these cities and on the subway. Any kind of public transit you're asking to be a victim of this clown car and the ambulance chasers that make money off them.

Like when someone comes out as gay, there's some story like ""Oh, you know your Uncle Charlie was gay, but different times then."" And people will share with you, and in the end I find that's it more rewarding personally. Like being who you were put on earth to be.",0

Some other examples that came to mind not to say any are worse than others since God considers all sin to be equally bad: idols, adultery, premarital sex, turning to oneself or worldly things to meet our needs instead of Jesus. These are just some that came to mind. Any church that promotes these is not Christian. It may be *based* on Christianity, but severely straying from the fundamentals.",0

I know that there are many ways to transition and that it's basically it's own spectrum, and many people know they never want the surgery.

"The only issue I have, which isn't really an issue just an observation and opinion, is the rights that gays/bis fight for are completely different for what trans fight for. Sexual Attraction and self identity are so different. One wants their marriage, adoption etc recognized. The other wants their gender and name recognized. I completely support trans people and their right to be themselves. But it doesn't go hand in hand with what gays are fighting for.

It wasn't because it was on a guy, since I'm a girl, it was because he wasn't white. Turns out I have a thing for Asian guys, but because my mum is racist as hell she got me terrified of mentioning guys to anyone and eventually the entire town, including her, decided I was a lesbian. I was kicked out of the house for it. Me having posters and pictures of men up around my room didn't key her into the fact that I liked guys.",0
"""Get fucked"" has never and will never imply a homosexual relationship? WTF, it's an insult used in place of ""fuck yourself"". I'm Aussie and hear ""get fucked"" countless times a day it's such an ingrained phrase. ""Fuck"" has never singularly meant ""to have sex"". It, as in this case, means to ruin/wreck something. So ""get fucked"" essentially means ""go ruin yourself"", which sounds quite lame. I'll use the phrase in a sentence for you: ""u/ripwanwinkle said the stupidest shit I've ever heard and they can get fucked.""",0

"Local LGBT groups will probably have the best info about what coming out in your area is like and where to get more support. For example, I live on the east edge of Iowa(kind of Iowa's east coast) which trends more supportive than the deeper red western Iowa. I don't know what Utah is like for trans people( I hear more from atheists trying to navigate Mormon dominated areas). General advise is strength in numbers, avoid situations where likely transphobes have it and find numbers to help you.",0
"I feel your pain, I always worry about what any partner would feel if I tell them I'm bi. I mean, if they're biphobic good, dodged that bullet. But sometimes they get so wrapped up in these feelings of insecurity and jealousy. Which I kind of get, but also, I could like anyone of *any* gender, and I like you! There are tons of guys, gals, and nonbinary pals out there, but you're the one who I like, and that should feel amazing, at least I think it should.",0

"I like masculine features and expressions in a man. For that reason, culturally, I cannot feel attracted to men with makeup and I feel some aversion to it.  I don't judge, but it's just not my cup of tea. Personally I wish the gay community could appreciate more the traditional masculine self-expressions",0

"When I cheat, it is because I have a wife and three submissives, who I love to tie up and experiment on. I cheat therefore I am. Sexual deviance means my wife gets treated like a queen.

Oh reread your post and actually your question is not that deep..! No I think how people identify is personal to them and finding a partner that loves you is a separate issue. Being a fem man is not at all being a trans woman.  If this isn't your own set of worries maybe you shouldn't concern yourself too much with it!,0

I'm aware of Muhammad Ali as an activist fighting for equality. I'm aware of Colin K as an activist fighting for equality. Simply making a few occasional remarks here and there does not make you an activist fighting fir equality. However I will allow fir the possibility that she may be doing stuff behind the scenes that I'm not aware of.,0
"Well that's kind of the point isn't it. I think the majority of trans person are aware that they can't change their biological sex. I don't think that's what matters to them. > change your lifestyle and not conform to social norms for the gender you're assigned, more power to you. Why wouldn't that include hormone treatment and surgery? If they want to look a certain way, why shouldn't they? I've never been one to tell people what they can and can't do with their bodies. You want tattoos, great. You want bigger tits, great. You want a forked tongue, great. You want different genitals, great.",0
"Thank you. I do see a lot of arguments directed towards us aces that are very similar to arguments I saw about bi people 10 to 20 years ago. For a long time, I even thought I was bi because my attraction to all genders is basically the same...just that it's little to none. It's all so sad to me.

Come out. Not living your truth has got to be so draining. If your family doesn't accept it at some point then it's their loss. There's nothing wrong with being gay. One of my best friends is First generation Korean and his family had a lot of trouble with it at first. After a couple years they came around. I think it basically came down to his dad missing him and telling the wife she had better figure out how to get over it.,0

Ah yes. A far right Christian theocracy where gays are caged and women forced to bear white cis children.

The topic of being gay came out organically with a few of them but over all it wasn't relevant most of the time, which was a break from it being so back home.  Like others who have commented here I live in a conservative country and I feel it gets in the way of most guys trusting and opening up to me. It would be nice to meet guys at home like the ones I met while traveling but it's been rare.",0

It really spoke to the unique alienation of a Black woman in the world in general but especially in predominately Caucasian settings - being belittled at work, being forced into a maternal role regardless of the circumstances, not being seen as a viable romantic partner, being isolated from social groups while Black men are able to ""fit in"" by conforming to stereotypes of coolness, athleticism, and sexual prowess, and being forced to rear children alone. Very unique perspective for a horror movie.",0

Yeah it really is sad and its something ive talked to my bf about a lot. So finding that was so amazing.

"Sentimental problems. Because let's be real. I never meet a girl that was able to give me the right advice with another girl. Anyway. Except this personal inconvenient, I am more open to share information with woman then males. The point is that I usually notice that woman take care about what is my point of view, and they understand not only what I'm saying, but why I'm saying. With males the conversation is a bit different, and I feel like I don't like share too much of myself. So I can defiantly say that what I share with male, I share with female.",0

"If my partner came out to me as trans, I would love snd support them, I might even try to stay, but I don't know if I could because, well, a lot of trans people go sort of crazy for a bit. Given the situation, this is actually quite reasonable, as they're trying to relearn about themselves and their bodies, there's often a lot of bew hormones and everything, plus all the every day life style changes. The person who begins that journey is often not the person who finishes it, which is fine and, again, quite understandable.",0
"I didn't so much discovered that I was bi as I discovered that not everyone was, lol. I grew up with LGBT family members, so I never had any concept that it was something to be worried about being.

Or whether you can be LGBT in a ""straight"" relationship. Or whether you're actually just an imposter. Or... I could go on and on.  Just know that these feelings are 100% extremely common in bi people. I can relate to all this. I know it's easier said than done, but try not to let these feelings get to you too much. You're bi and you belong in the LGBT+ community as much as any other LGBT+ person. :)",0

Coming out is something very intimate. It means sharing a very personal fact about yourself with people. Only you should decide who gets to know you like that. If you think someone doesn't deserve to have this kind of information or you fear what they might do with it then you have no obligation to tell them. However you might be missing out on a very profound and supportive friendship and I think that friends and allies are crucial to a happy life as a gay person.  In the end the choice is yours to make. I hope I could help. You'll find your way. We all will.,0

Dont worry thats not a reason. I know quite a few gay people and imm very supportive of all this and sometimes find man+man relationships in a way a lot more.. human? Special? Really the most beautiful human connections ive ever witnessed were probably gay men. I dont know its hard to explain. But never ever felt attracted to women in my life. So its really not about your friends. You dont get gay by having gay friends.,0

"My life has improved dramatically since I first came out when I was 15. Being able to take control of my life and transition both socially and physically has been amazing. What most people don't know is that when you are trans you don't just come out once. There's coming out to your family, your friends, at school, at work. It never actually ends. Every new person you meet is someone that you might come out to. You also have to decide if you want to come out to someone. You don't have to. It might be unsafe to. It might work out wonderfully and you'll gain a new ally.",0

I also accept that some people believe they were born as the wrong gender, or feel that their body does not represent who they truly are. I feel empathy for both groups of people and am thankful I'm not them.",0
"I consider it a health condition, which has my sympathy. I can't imagine what it would be like to wish more than anything to be born the opposite sex. That has to be difficult, even though it's not in itself life threatening like cancer or a disability like blindness. This is only my speculation, but I think people generally would have a more sympathetic view of issues facing trans people if the public discourse was from a health standpoint rather than a sharply political one.",0

You can take the serious approach and explain that in the past you experienced a bout of mental illness and stuff you read on the internet convinced you that transitioning was essential to your well being.

"Honestly I understand the reason for it. I don't think the LGBTQ community is oppressed, but it wasn't that long ago that they were. While they aren't oppressed by our government, many in the community (especially teens) often aren't accepted by their families and are often disowned and abused. Pride month is a way of acknowledging the progress that's been made and supporting those in the community that are still vulnerable. I don't understand why people can't simply ignore it if they don't want to be involved instead of being actively against it. They aren't hurting anyone.",0

There is a cure for them it's called hanging. The answers right in front of your eyes it is a sickness just like trans gender just like gay they're all dysphoria.

You cannot change what you are just because you think so if I think I'm a millionaire do I suddenly get $PHONE in my bank account it's stupid.

"OP IS LITERALLY THE REASON THIS COMMENT WAS MADE! If people can get away with people for them being genetically ""lesser"" what does that mean for literally any minority? ""Gay people are a burden on society 'cause they don't reproduce"" *so let's kill them!* I understand this logic but I don't think any of you hear how horrible it sounds. If you know that your kid is going to have problems at birth and you decide to abort that's on you, but this IS literally fucking genocide.",0
"Thank you all for your encouraging comments. The pain of years of rejection coupled with rejection of my feminine self and the constant negativity and homophobia and transphobia got to be too much. So for the time being I'm retreating as deep in the closet as I can possibly go, and the dysphoria is as real as the tears running down my cheeks.  I love you all. Charli",0
"Also I deadass just made you my bitch. Just like I said you to your follower bitch made self. I said reply to me again you fucking pussy and guess what you did. You listened to the supposed ""weak little bitch boy"" gtfoh a 15 year old just made you his bitch 😂. Just like you and your faggot ass ugly fucking mom I made both of y'all my bitch :) hope you sleep bad tonight beta bitch. Sweet dreams, PUSSY! 😝😂",1
"There is a really big gap between men and women in most sports. However, any man that thinks they are going to compete against a professional (not just a professional, but one of the best in her sport) is crazy.",0
"Not ""everyone"", but most people. I'm bisexual and I've been dating this great guy for nine months. He's the sweetest person I've ever met.",0
why are white transes like this lmaooooooooooooo also don't think we forgot about you posting yourself in blackface bitch gtfo ,1
I'm Bi and I am proud of what I made. This is a very welcoming sub so I wanted to share,0
Turning your hurt into support for others at pride is really lovely. I hope you continue to find joy in femininity. :),0
"As well as the scientific community, the World Health Organization, and anyone who's done even the slightest amount of research into what gender identity is. Knowing that gender identity exists on spectrum is really not that complicated, or new.",0
Got it. Thanks for the clarifying and congrats for you on being open and proud about your sexuality. It's a hard journey for many to accept and is a beautiful thing when people can be open and confident about who they truly are!,0
"Among people my age lgbt is pretty much just a meme. There are lots of gay/lesbian/bi people who are totally normal and they are always accepted, even by the religious kids. But the ones who obnoxiously fit all the lgbt stereotypes are literally considered a fucking joke. Personally I have no problem with anybody like that until their actions start to affect my life.",1
"@Duane4PG @Smileyoufake96 I honestly don't know how parents can do that, if my kids ever told me that they were gay, lesbian, bi etc I wouldn't care love is love,, I love them no matter what 💖",0

"If you have to ask then kill yourself, faggot.",1
"I can easily tell by this video that you are a man with fragile masculinity and irrealistic standards, and, truly, i feel bad for you",0
❤️ for sure! Feels awful to think of people discriminating against me just for my sexual orientation. Happy to help y'all in any way I can :),0
"Same. I'm 27 and only this year realized I'm a lesbian, after years thinking I was bi, making excuses to not date men, and trying explain why I don't want to be with men, well, turns out it's because I'm a lesbian that never really questioned my lack of attraction to men. Ahh, feels good, like a huge weight lifted off my shoulders!",0
"genuinely like as a trans person it becomes difficult to differentiate regular bodily insecurities and dysphoria sometimes so i'll realize i'm insecure about something that was previously ""unimportant"" compared to my dysphoria/was heightened by hrt and i'll be like OH GOD WAS IT",0
GET THE FUCK OFF ME FAGGOT,1
"Ya maybe your ancestors were faggy little cuck beta-swedes, but my long ship long dick, Norse-chad ancestors. Would slap the fuck outta ur whole lineage, don't come around me or my friends every again bozo.",1
"I wasn't intentionally trying to misinterpret you, I just thought it would be problematic if any group of people found it offensive to celebrate the LGBT members of their group. I personally don't see anything wrong with having Mohammad, Jesus, or any religious figure in rainbow garb. More power to them.",0
They're all legit faggots,1
"So they're going to make it more appealing with lots of naughty words in their pro feminist, pro ethnic minority T""her""minator, complete with the LGBT-1000.",0

"@abcnews @ajamesbragg @PatsKarvelas Why is religion so preoccupied with homosexuality? I am running a small crowdfunding campaign to support my PhD research on this topic. If this interests you, click here to learn more ",0
"Trans people exist. They are our friends, they are our allies, they are our family. They deserve to be recognised.",0
Yeah but... you're still gay and childish :) You said nothing to disprove that. Keep posting. Maybe it'll chase the robots away some day :),0
"So-called ""gay and trans panic"" defenses can excuse violent crimes by blaming a victim's sexual orientation or gender identity for a defendant's attack. @RepJoeKennedy and I have introduced legislation to ban the use of these hateful defenses in all federal courts. ",0
Early Christians locked the doors during Liturgy so no one would break in and kill them. Now Christians will have to lock the doors so faggots won't break in desecrate the church,1
You fookin homophobic piece of shit.,0
"That movie was a fucking faggot fest. Just watch Valley of the Dolls, The Long Goodbye and Van Nuys Boulevard. As much as Cum Town hates on copying... this QT faggot is the princess of Adaming other people's ideas. Fuck Once Upon A Guy in Hollyfag and fuck Quentin Barebackino and all you fags who lick his taint and think his amusement park ride version of cinema is good. You're all fucking queer jerkoffs if you like him. QT is a gay bitch in a bad way. 100% not a Cum Boy.",1

"Kind of in the same boat, except my parents are still together and they both are trans and homophobic and the only way for me to transition is if I move to a different state. I know how you feel and I'm sorry your dad has to be that way.",0
"To see queer people keeping each other down makes me so sad because I've been around for a long time - I've seen the people who came before us fight for what we have right now, and they did not fight like that for us to go backwards. Michelle Visage",0
Hit me with all the gay shit,0
Also this gay dude is a chronic apologizer,0
I thought everyone already knew he was gay 😂😂😂😂,0
"The US currently [does not have a federal law](-out/can-you-be-fired-being-gay-answer-depends-largely-where-n962711) in effect that protects discrimination from your employer due to sexual orientation like it does for sex and race. There are many trying to get that changed, but it is being challenged in courts but many still oppose it. Having companies outright declare their support for LGBT rights is still incredibly important, no matter how much they also stand to benefit from it.",0
Pussy is a homophobic slur now?,0
"They call it 'dysphoria' ---folks tend to kill themselves if its not treated Right now, letting folks be trans is the treatment I think its caused by chemicals in our environment which disrupt the endocrine system, but nobody really knows what makes folks trans. Main thing is, there's only gonna be more of them and they don't care what some little punk in high school thinks, so fuck off, you stupid fucking pussy",0
">In my day you had to kinda pick a team, you were gay or straight... Can I ask what days you're referring to? I just came out to my parents, 66 & 67, who frankly do not understand bisexuality at all. It blows my mind. I had to use a really strange interracial comparison to help my mother out. :(",0
"I feel ya. For me I've been trying to get into the LGBT community since coming out a few years back (I'm now 39). And people are clickkkkkkky. I grew up in MN And have been in the cities more than half of my life. I've made friends & grown apart from friends. From experience I met them at work (now i work from Home - no one to meet here 😂), church (don't go anymore haven't found a affirming one i like). Been thinking of doing some meet up groups & volunteering.",0
"Making trans jokes is just punching downwards/low hanging fruit/and usually just plain ignorant and neckbeardy.  ""HURRDURR SUICIDE FUNNY HAHA MAN IN DRESS FUNNY""",0
"Hi, if you want to balance out the ""friends"" opinion on gay relationships maybe check out Tom Daley on YouTube. He has some wholesome vlogs with his husband Lance Black. There is a lot teasing and bickering, but you can see the love and they are awesome humans in general. Seeing them beeing so comfortable and confident with who they are helped me accept my own sexuality as a bi woman, maybe it can show you the happier side of things too. Either way, good luck and take all the time you need to figure things out :)",0
That AIDs weigh a ton nigga ,1
"She propped up on my desk kinda close. Innocuous. Talking about work stuff. Today, just, she was chillin in a chair with her legs sort of open a bit, tight shirt, skinny rippled jeans. She's petite, edgy, cusses aplenty. Little bitty but what a popping personality. God I wanna fuck her",0
"Tell him you're going to decimate him, decapitate him, let him know you're going to drink the tears of his wife & kids. Just don't, under any circumstance call him gay. That's just going too far.",0
