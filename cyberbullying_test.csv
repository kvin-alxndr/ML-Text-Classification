"Yeah the Bible says gay sex is a sin... But also list -divorce -adultery -masturbation - sodomy (oral and anal) even with a woman -having children out of wedlock As being just as bad, but religious types never mention that.",0
Sounds like she found a way to ground him for being gay.,0
I know they're genderswapped but I didn't expect fem squadra to be cute,0
"One of my friends is in a relationship like this and it drives me nuts when she posts pictures of ""her and her wife"" who is a ""trans butch lesbian""....Honey, that's a straight man and you're bi so maybe don't call yourselves lesbians üôÉ Everything she does is or has to be ""gay"" and I don't have it in me (yet...I may yet snap, we'll see lol) to call her out on it. Being gay isn't a personality trait (especially when you're not exclusively same-sex attracted) and being the ""most woke"" isn't necessarily the best thing.  Sorry, I have no one to vent this shit to lol",0
Fuck you smurf ass faggot. Go drink bleach.,1
"As a fellow 31 yr old Bi man, more power to ya! Have fun, hope it all goes well.",0
She has boobs and she is a trans so technically its not totally gay,0
"You people should be proud to be gay,lesbian,bisexual,or Pansexual you should love your self/sexuality there are other people in the world that cannot be gay or lesbian or any pride beside straight Because their family would not except them for who they are except yourself for who you are remember love yourself",0
"Yess especially when you don't feel welcome in your own community. I identify as gay but I've been with men before so sometimes I honestly worry that I'll meet someone I really like but who doesn't accept me, and that thought is upsetting.",0

"The sad part is that you're blind to the fact that porn producers recruit the black guys with the biggest dicks they can find in order to promote this fetish category. Also, notice how they are paired with girls who weigh 100 lbs and stand 5' tall...oh yeah, wow, it's as big as my tiny forearm! Good grief man, open your eyes and educate yourself! If nothing else, paint your dick black then convince everyone that because it's color is black that it's now bigger. So fucking stupid.",0
And you're gay because you're gay,0
"Wow. Thank you, @ArianaGrande for not being afraid to shut down this sexism and homophobia. ",0

Black men sing love songs and can be romantic. Look at Marvin Gaye,0
"I realize that this isn't the Peace Corps party line on approaching community norms, but about a year in, I frankly stopped caring what others, even counterparts, thought about such things.  I decided that since I didn't feel unsafe or that it would dramatically impact my service, I should come out in order to give everyone a gay that they knew, even if I am a foreigner. It's easy to bedevil a population when they feel far removed, but giving them a real person they know is what ultimately changes hearts and minds.",0

"Our struggle is kinda the opposite? I'm androgynous but leaning to the masculine side because I don't know how to get in touch with my feminine side, and I've never given myself a chance to get in touch with it because of boys. I kinda get how you feel (in a way?), it's so hard to be feminine knowing that boys will line up right in front of you and even if I tell them that I'm a lesbian, most will shrug it off and will continue to their advances.",0
"Well,as gay man, I definitely have the hots for those jacked up dudes just not the so absurd that it's disgusting, and for example Kratos is very not that is very muscular but not disgusting like. This whole situation feels weird because the women sexyfied characters are made for men, and the sexyfied men are made for... men, so basically gay guys are on the win here (depending on your onw tastes of course) and women are at complete loss which end at this situation becoming very, **interesting**",0
"These two black homos are racist just for constantly talking about race . Motherfuckers , stop . LGBTQ. IT'S KGBDQ . Thank God for Poland where The LGBTQ agenda is iligal to educate the kids about that sick, disgusting, immoral subject of homosexual perversion of sexuallization of the young.",1

"My wife and I were in our 12th year of marriage when I came out. She said she firgured and wasn't surprised. We talked about it for a day or two and then just went back to our regular old lives. A week or so later we laughed because of how chill it was. She looked and me and said, ""I feel like this should be a bigger deal, but it's not."" I love my wife.  Other people around us just assumed our marriage was exploding. Cool cool.",0

"i wasn't even out when i felt like a lesbian. first i was like ""hey, i don't like dating straight women."" then i was dating bi and pan women but i was like ""i don't want to be a man in any relationship."" and finally im gey and i smooch lesbians and i have a gay ass girlfriend. i think it was the relief of my dysphoria that made me feel more comfortable with my sexual identity",0
"Scientific facts, right here If religion had never ruined earth by stopping scientific research during the dark ages, by now I'd not be single because I'd have some foxy robot sex slaves to do my dick bidding or at least three legged multipussy scorching hot space alien fanny to dive into! So in other words, religion needs to be destoryed so can have the sex! It's not fair!!!",0
we live in a society where so many people tell us we're delusional for being trans. I have a supportive family and even they say that I should really question myself whether I want to transition. we're being made unsure at every turn. it's not your fault you have doubts.,0
I understand that corporations do a lot of LGBTQ branding and activism to entice customers...but honestly it could be the other way around. Still proud to see rainbow logos and ads that raise awareness for equality! üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà,0

Yeah no homophobic in that at all. You're quoting Bubba The Love Sponge? I remember when Bubba won the Nobel ... no wait ... the Pulitiz ... no wait ... it's Bubba The Fucking Love Sponge. Jesus A Christ that is literally the best you have? I'm no fan of Tucker. In fact I've given up Fox News because like CNN and MSNBC it's just a team. I refuse teams.

"Acceptance of others decisions to be who they are.  I know that it is not the same at all schools, but the kids now seem to be way less phased about race or LGBTQIA than in the past. I'm not saying there aren't issues, but it doesn't seem to be much of a thing. Most of the information around this that goes out is more geared towards making the parents comfortable.  They also seem to be less religious, and if they are, a general spiritual belief rather than organized religious; more accepting of others beliefs, or lack thereof.",0
"Some people Point out hot Girls to me and seing the short moment of confusion, afterwards I am assured that they don¬¥t have a Problem with gay people/are accepting. Always nice to hear them talk About their gay Children, Cousins, Friends, coworkers and who not. Especially old Folks, it is all the time cute to listen to them talk About stuff like that.",0
Trannies are too fragile mentally to be in a competitive atmosphere,1
"oh i know, that's the point. thankfully my girlfriend was fine with my transition but not all trans people are so fortunate and it's really not anyone's obligation. I think the act of asking someone ""hey if i transitioned would you still love me"" and expecting them to just say yes is really making light of what transitioning actually is, what's involved, etc etc and so on",0
"YTA. We have to come out. A lot of our families don't accept it. It's not the same thing gay and lesbian and bi people face, but it's a thing nevertheless.",0
Not interested in this BS. Lesbian terminator vs Mexican terminator.,0
Cute boi with the trans flag uvu,0

"If you live in a city it's actually not that hard if you are willing to get out of your comfort zone. Attend a local lgbt activity group. It can soccer, rugby, board games, video games, bar crawls, whatever is your hobby. You meet new friends and sometimes meet someone you really click with. I made friends with a gay couple who also liked boards games and going to movies. We hung out regularly (we still do) and I met my current boyfriend through them.",0

Black trans women in Middle Eastern countries don't have a life expectancy at all. ,0
"Agreed. Exposure to different sexualities is a good thing, even if the underlying reason isn't always a 100% altruistic.

I have a nephew that I am close with, but it's not the same. As time moves forward I find gender less and less of a thing. I love my child regardless that she is a girl. Congrats!!!",0

"I relate to this a lot. It's very similar to the biphobia I experience occasionally in gay and straight communities. Because in a way demisexuals can be ""allo-passing"" when in a relationship (read: can experience sexual attraction), some full-ace people see that as not truly the same struggle or truly knowing what it's like to be full-ace. It's hard to find community and acceptance in the middle of the spectrum. I'd say for the most part the ace community is pretty inclusive, but this does happen sometimes. I'm so sorry you're experiencing that in the community you tried to find at school :(",0

"I'm female and came out to my mom as bi when I was 18. It took her like 4y to integrate that YES I'm bi. While my big brother came out before me as bi too and for her he was automatically bisexual and she never questioned it (he also passed shortly after so conversation was over eh). She'll get to it, it can take her time, if she doesn't see you with a guy I think it's not 'really real' for her",0

That's cute. I love seeing gay couples together. Love always finds a way.,0

I do think in my opinion there is problems with the equality act in that it takes an all or nothing approach. Like we need the equality act but I as a trans woman I Don't think I belong in every woman's space especially prior to transitioning. If you don't take hrt but identify as trans that's fine but I don't think competing with biological woman should be allowed in sports. I think there's a compromise here somewhere.,0
"More conflation of sex and gender..  I. Am. Shocked üôÑ I, a GNC, child free woman, am a survivor of rape who's had a rape kit exam (which includes a swipe of my cervix) AND given Plan B, why?  Because unlike you, I AM FEMALE, and those services were created (and fought for) specifically to combat the sex based oppression I face as a female.  He will never understand what being female entails no mater how any women refuse to wax his saggy ass MALE testicles.  Fuck him with a sick dick sideways, entitled asshat.",0
His advice isn't exclusively for males. It resonates the most with males and I don't see that as a bad thing unlike many of his detractors. He basically wants people to be the best version of themselves and take personal responsibility.  I disagree that feminism is identify politics. It depends on the feminist and their particular brand of feminism. If group identify is more important than the individual then they are engaging in identity politics.,0
Fuck off slut gay idiot,1
the gender pay gap has been proven false on so many different occasions why is it still a political talking point.,0

"I'm still super ambivalent about HRT because I'm transmasc at most and will probably keep on wearing skirts and dresses even after top surgery because that's what makes me feel happy and confident.

"Probably,I never got into a relationship so I don't know if I could be demi or not. And yeah,my parents would maybe disown if I was gay/bisexual.. It's like you can only be straight or asexual. No being gay or bi... ;-;",0

Same goes for the unique struggles lesbian women go through. Having empathy for other people is a huge necessity imo. Glad to find a place with it :) happy pride to you as well!,0
"Yo, I'm not an ace, but y'all are totally welcome in the LGBTQ+ community and spaces. I don't experience asexuality, but if people being sexually attracted to just 1 sex and/or gender is real, then having no sexual attraction is real too.

"I never said there's anything wrong with having male role models. If you wanted to see the best of the best and a woman happened to be one of the best soccer players alive, wouldn't it be cool to give her chance to compete with the best and not be limited by her gender ?",0

Do you know for sure hes gay?,0
"Damn. The feels man. I have come out to 7 people. I call them my safe harbors. My ex wife sn ex girl friend (who I now share dick stories with) some friends from high school (biggest hurdle) a gay couple I know, and a pan woman I used to work with. All working toward telling my parents I'm Bi. Funny thing is many years ago my dad said if I was gay they would still love and support me. So they probably had some suspicions.  Fooled them. I'm Bi so I hid in the shadows for years.  This thing resonates with me so much.",0
Hoe fuck u,1
"The left is disgusting. Those sick freaks definitely push homosexuality and gay weird stuff on children like lgbtq or whatever the fuck that means. How is this even legal what they are doing? Same way how they make all that nasty porn and Hollywood always depicting faggots, lesbians and interracial shit. They are promoting it. They are filth. Something needs to be done about these people.",1
"This was so wholesome and so sweet. I'd totally cuddle you bro. No homo, but also not against it as I am bi lmao",0
You're right we should definitely gather all the mentally ill transgenders and put them on an island them nuke the island and boom less mentally ill people on the planet,1

Unbelievable! We truly know no end to degeneracy do we people!? Get a fucking grip on reality! You aren't going to suck her dick in real life! You aren't going to get to cum all over her abs in real life! Best you filthy degenerates will do is jizz on your figurines or body pillows!

Hol' up they are gay and you're the one telling them?,0
Kawhis a fag,1
"Not gay but bi so close enough. I don't dress overly girly or overly ""masculine."" I don't go out of my way to really dress any certain style, I just go with what I like. I do think it's good to have a degree of anonymity so everyone doesn't judge (subconsciously or consciously) you right away. However, they won't tend to take you seriously when you mention you're LGBT. Like I could say I'm interested in girls (as a girl myself) and if I don't ""look the part"" or like a stereotype, then it might be hard for many people to believe you.",0
i hate these gay losers ,1
"US women's national soccer team co-captain Megan Rapinoe didn't realize she was gay until she was in college. ""It's so embarrassing because I'm just very gay but... as soon as it clicked... I was like 'ah! she has arrived. She's here. Her life is beginning.'"" ",0
She still looks like an insecure sexually confused girl.,0
Don't worry man. A lot of dance teachers here are very openly gay and a lot of students from my school are as well :),0
"As A 5'6 18 year old what i can say to fellow short men is to Bodybuild and Mind Build ,Its Mostly all in the mind ,if your confidence and self esteem is sky high you can get any girl ,Most of the girls i deal with are taller than me or my height and i feel so dominant the fact that im so masculine that i can still make a girl who is taller than me feel feminine",0

Your the faggot with a fish tank. Your life must be pathetic as fuck,1
Probably both would be pissed up and it would be over before the blink of an eye before anyone could think about anything . Absolute shit like this will be getting people fucked up . Grab the cunts face and stick your thumb as far in his eye as it will go . That stops them. These two queer cunts talk to much,1

"Yes, ask her who she spoke with about coming out and see if she can help you or introduce people in her trans network to you to help start the initial process of claiming and becoming the real you.  After all, this is PRIDE Month all month long.",0
"I'm sorry you had to endure hurtful comments as a kid. I recently settled into the label of genderqueer. It took me years and years to figure out what felt right to me because of some similar stuff with my parents growing up. I hope that things get easier for you.

I am a cis man who is happily married to a cis woman and we have kids together. I couldn't look more straight if I tried. üòÜ I didn't come to recognize and accept being Bi until I was in my forties and married with kids; but I proudly identify as Bi because I know that I am attracted to women in everyway and I am attracted to other men physically and sexually. I also know that if presented with the right person and situation I would be with another man; providing that it wouldn't risk losing my wonderful wife and marriage. I hope this helps you to accept yourself for who you are! ü§óüíì üíôüíú‚ù§,0
Cishet always wait until their dicks itch and burn to worry about their sexual health. What the fuck does body count matter if you don't even know each other's sexual health. It's probably been more than a year since you got tested and you worried about body count?,0
You know what to do faggots,1
I really dislike when people weaponize the Bible,0
"Absolutely. And to any outsider they are a same sex couple. They will endure the same harassment as any same sex couple. My wife and I are in that boat. She's cis, we've been married since before I transitioned, and to those not aware that I'm trans, we look like a lesbian couple. And we are! I would have no issues with campaigning for marriage equality, and we have before.",0
"Do they love you back? Do your parents and siblings love you, despite your sexuality? If you're not sure, you need to find out. If the answer is yes, it doesn't matter whether they accept your sexuality, because they respect you. If the answer is no, then, and I know this is hard, but they are not good to keep around. I've lost friends of mine to that kind of home situation. It's not worth spending your time on unrequited love, especially if it's met with abuse. As I said, you matter, not their vision of you.",0
Alright so where are the cute queers from other countries who want to 90 Day Fianc√© me out of this hell hole?,0
"Lady Skeptic your response if precisely one of the problems with this community. He cited Fox News so some how it's not factual because of the source?  As I've stated this topic has to be open for discussion and presenting things that maybe insensitive to someone is not the problem of the presenter.  Are you going to tell me you don't have a problem with the trans woman MMA fighter who has been a man, a man with children for 30 years then one day jumps in an octagon and beats the shit out of a biological female? Is that okay with you?",0
